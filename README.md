Here’s a simple step-by-step description of how to run your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript portfolio project in VS Code:

⸻

1. Install VS Code (if not already installed)
	•	Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/
	•	Install and open it.

⸻

2. Open your project folder
	•	Go to File → Open Folder.
	•	Select the folder containing your index.html, style.css, and script.js.

⸻

3. Install Live Server extension (recommended)
	•	Click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
	•	Search for “Live Server” by Ritwick Dey.
	•	Click Install.

⸻

4. Open index.html
	•	In the Explorer panel, double-click on index.html to open it.

⸻

5. Run the project
	•	Right-click anywhere in index.html and choose “Open with Live Server”.
	•	Your browser will open showing the portfolio site.
	•	Any changes you save will automatically refresh in the browser.

⸻

6. Without Live Server (manual method)
	•	Just double-click your index.html file from File Explorer / Finder.
	•	It will open in your default browser, but you’ll have to refresh manually after edits.

If you want, I can also give you a short one-paragraph description for your README explaining how to run it in VS Code. Would you like me to make that?
